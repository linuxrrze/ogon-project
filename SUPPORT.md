# How to get help?!

> Note: Please don't file issues to ask **questions**. Questions are no bugs ;). Use one of the resources below for that.


## Documentation

Currently the documentation is rather sparse. But we are working hard on improving it.
[What we have so far](https://github.com/ogon-project/ogon/tree/master/doc).
Possibly the most interesting bits to get started:

* [build documentation for Debian/Ubuntu](https://github.com/ogon-project/ogon/blob/master/doc/build-debian-ubuntu.md)
* [session manager configuration](https://github.com/ogon-project/ogon/blob/master/doc/config.md)

## Mailing list

For questions, discussion, suggestions we use the [ogon-project google group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ogon-project).
The E-mail address of the group is [ogon-project@googlegroups.com](mailto:ogon-project@googlegroups.com).


## IRC

 If you have questions or want to talk about the project you find us in IRC on [freenode channel
 #ogon-project](irc://chat.freenode.net/ogon-project). If you don't have a IRC client installed:
 [freenode](https://freenode.net/) offers a [web interface](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ogon-project)

We usually help as soon as we can. But don't expect an instant answer, sometimes it takes
a little, so please be patient in that case.
