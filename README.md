This project/repository is mainly used as issue tracker
for all components of the ogon projects.

## What is the ogon project?

The ogon project is an open source driven collection of services and tools mainly written in C/C++
that provide graphical remote access to Linux desktop sessions using the Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP). It supports most modern RDP protocol extensions, bitmap compression codecs, dis- and
reconnection to sessions and device redirections.
ogon is compatible with virtually any existing RDP Client.

Any X11 destkop, weston or qt application can be used as session. Due to it's modular
design it's easily possible to extend or add features or add new backends.
